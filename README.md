# IPoC

IPoC is a general purpose tunnelling protocol that enables all IP applications to utilize Information Centric Networks. 
We implement the IPoC protocol using Named Data Networking (NDN) semantics and using mobile communication as the driving example,
show how NDN and IPoC can bring ICN benefits to 5G mobile networks by simplifying the mobility plane, introducing intelligent 
functionality, and reducing network complexity.

The full ndnSIM package is provided here for improving usability. The IPoC specific protocol implementations are in 
"examples/ip-over-ndn" directory.
